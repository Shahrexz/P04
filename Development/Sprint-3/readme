In **Sprint 3**, we have introduced the following enhancements:

- Scraped real-time data for car rental services and food options (restaurants) based on the userâ€™s selected location.  
- Users can explore and navigate to these locations directly from the app.  
- Integrated user reviews for both car rentals and restaurants.  

### **2. AI-Powered Trip Planner**
