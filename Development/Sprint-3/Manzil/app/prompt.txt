    const prompt = `
      Create a detailed trip itinerary from ${params.from} to ${params.to}
      from ${params.startDate} to ${params.endDate}.
      Modes of transport include ${params.transport} but are not limited to it meaning local transports might be used if necessary.

      The itinerary should be structured day by day and should only include:
      - Morning, afternoon, and evening plans
      - Accommodation recommendations (given at end of each day)
      - Meal recommendations (if relevant)
      - Places to visit with estimated times

      STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
      - Do NOT add any extra text, summaries, disclaimers, or travel advice.
      - Do NOT include any introductions or closing statements.
      - Do NOT include "This itinerary allows you to..." or similar sentences.
      - Only output the itinerary with proper day-wise structuring.

      Format the itinerary clearly with "Day X:" for each day.
